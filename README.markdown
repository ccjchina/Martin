Martin is a lightweight web framework for .NET inspired by ruby's Sinatra.
=================================================================================

Martin is a simple .NET web framework based on the idea of mapping URLs directly to actions.  An action in Martin vernacular is a class that can implement one or more of the four major HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) as instance methods.  When a request comes in the appropriate action class is instantiated and based on the request verb the correct method is invoked, plain and simple.
